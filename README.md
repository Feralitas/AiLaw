Working through documents is tiring and time-consuming. Often the information necessary to understand the document is missing. Then you have to switch to another application to convert currencies, look up legal texts, check data, or search for company information. This is time-consuming and leads to confusion. Our goal is to make the process of working through documents fast and efficient.


# What it does

AiLaw provides you all the information you need directly in your documents. No more Windows switching. You can easily access the information by selecting the appropriate passage in the document. Supporting not only Word and PDF formats but all selectable texts. For example, click on a date and see directly what day of the week it was and how many days/years it is in the past or future, e.g. for the day of birth.
